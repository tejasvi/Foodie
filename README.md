# Foodie

Foodie is a web based app to rate meals and assign score (1-10) to the offerings. Features include adding comments and viewing the score of the individual items. It is heavily optimised for large workloads within constraints of heroku's free plans.
I have also created an android wrapper for it. Many thanks to awesome project Android-PWA-Wrapper by Martin.
Try it at http://f00die.herokuapp.com on browser or install it from http://is.gd/foodieapp for android. (If not a denizen of IIT Guwahati, enter the full email to login)


Build instructions:
To deploy to Heroku, enable the Postgress database and build the contents of foodie folder.
Building an android pacakage is straightforward using Android Studio. Headover to https://github.com/xtools-at/Android-PWA-Wrapper for customization :)
